Demo track — Autonomous Driving Lab Autonomous Driving Lab Discover ADL The Lab Research Teaching Blog The Lab Making cars drive by themselves means that we absolutely must play with all the impressive equipment at our disposal. Take a look at what we’re working with! Vehicle Software Simulation Parking lot Demo track Demo track Once our experimenting with a new piece of self-driving tech has proven itself reliable in the simulated environment and our closed course , we are confident enough to enter everyday traffic on our demo track. The demo track consists of a loop that takes the vehicle through the city centre of Tartu. The demo track consists of a variety of sections and junctions, including: 7 regulated pedestrian crossings 4 unregulated pedestrian crossings 2 regulated intersections 4 bus stops 1 lane change 1 right turn 1 roundabout HD MAPS Maps We have mapped the demo track in its entirety and have made them publicly available.
