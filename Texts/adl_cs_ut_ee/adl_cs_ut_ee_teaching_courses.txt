If you feel the same way and want to be smart enough to do something about it, then rest assured: you’ve come to the right place. Courses Thesis topics Defended theses Minicar Challenge The Rally Estonia Challenge Courses One of our goals is to prepare future workforce for the up-and-coming autonomous driving industry in Estonia (and elsewhere) — this is a long process. Providing the students here at the Institute of Computer Science with a variety of courses that provide them with an opportunity to get familiar with the basics of self-driving software, is a critical first step. Here is an overview of the different courses taught at our institute. Be sure to check out the links that take you to the Study Information System, if you’re interested in the specifics! INTRODUCTORY COURSE Fundamentals of Autonomous Driving 6 ECTS LTAT.06.011 Lecturer: NAVEED MUHAMMAD Content and relation to ADL activities: Introduces all the sub-problems that need to be solved to build an autonomous driving system. Learn more INTRODUCTORY COURSE Introduction to Data Science 6 ECTS LTAT.02.002 Lecturer: MEELIS KULL Content and relation to ADL activities: Sensor data analysis is at the core of modern self-driving. This course gives a brief overview of the basic concepts, principles and practice of data science. The main goal is to learn to plan and carry out a simple practical data science project. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Machine Learning 6 ECTS MTAT.03.227 Lecturer: DMYTRO FISHMAN Content and relation to ADL activities: Introduces the core concepts of machine learning and data science. Allows to do a project related to AD. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Neural Networks 6 ECTS LTAT.02.001 Lecturer: RAUL VICENTE Content and relation to ADL activities: Introduces ML algorithms called neural networks (NNs). NNs are mainly used in the perception module of modular stacks for autonomous driving, but also in other modules. In end-to-end driving approaches, the entire driving stack is one big neural network. Also, there is a possibility to do a project that is related to autonomous driving. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Deep Learning for Computer Vision 6 ECTS LTAT.02.028 Lecturer: Dmytro Fishman From recognising number plates to detecting highly invasive renal 
masses, computer vision algorithms have become a key driving force 
behind many areas vital for modern society, including transportation, 
medicine, e-commerce, art, and entertainment. Deep neural networks are 
at the heart of this progress. This course will dive into the core 
computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, 
and segmentation from the perspective of deep neural networks. We will 
review the main architectures, training pipelines, and performance 
metrics used in these tasks. Additionally, we will explore more advanced
 computer vision topics, such as image generation, attention and 
transformers, and self-supervised and weakly supervised learning. 
Students will gain the practical skills necessary to complete a 
real-life computer vision project. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Optimization for Robot Control 3 ECTS LOTI.05.084 Lecturer: ARUN SINGH Content and relation to ADL activities: Basics on optimization, especially in light of trajectory optimization, model predictive control from the point of view of robotics motion planning and control. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Motion Planning and State Estimation in Robotics 3 ECTS LOTI.05.083 Lecturer: ARUN SINGH Content and relation to ADL activities: Basics of robot motion planning, control, and state estimation. Tasks like navigating mobile robots through obstacle filled environments. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Autonomous Vehicles Project 6 ECTS LTAT.06.012 Lecturer: NAVEED MUHAMMAD Content and relation to ADL activities: Allows you to spend a considerable amount of time on a topic of your choice related to AD. Learn more RELATED SUBTASKS Robotics Technology 6 ECTS LOTI.05.057 Lecturer: KARL KRUUSAMÄE Content and relation to ADL activities: Introduces using the Robot Operating System (ROS) that is also used on the ADL’s self-driving Lexus.
