Chosen topics ID Name Topic Date 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Some arbitrary possible topics Color blending – What happens when there are transparent objects in your scene? Lighting models – What are the common models? Where and when are they used? Texturing – How can one sample from a texture? What kinds of artefacts may appear? Curves – Why are they important in CG? What about curved surfaces? Global illumination – Pick one or compare different methods: Radiosity , path tracing , photon mapping . Realtime realistic rendering – Provide an overview of the common methods or pick some effect ( light , wetness , fog , fur / hair , skin ) and find out how it's rendered realistically in real time. Non-realistic rendering – Where is it used and how is it achieved? Realtime vs prerendered? Tessellation – How can this be done in OpenGL 4 ? Post-processing effects – What effects are there? When and how are they used? Procedural generation ( PCG wiki ) – Where and how is it used? How to apply procedural textures to procedurally generated meshes? Physically-Based Shading – What is it? Why is it important to understand physical properties of materials for shading? What games / game engines use it? Rendering in VR – What extra considerations are in VR? How do different technologies overcome them? Vulkan – What can be done with it? Why is it useful? How to Vulkan? Subsurface scattering – What is it? How it is implemented? What does it solve? Reflections and caustics – What are the modern techniques, which do those? GLSL vs HLSL – What are the differences? How are both used? Case study – Find out in detail how graphics are done in one game or movie: The Code Corsair blog has several case study articles. Dreams engine by Alex Evans ( slides , second video ) Claybook - a game using exlusively SDFs. GTA V - Graphics Study . ... Motion capture – What are the difficulties today? Best budget setup for it? Modern GPU architecture – How are GPU-s built today? What are they optimized for? E.g. Vega , Kepler , Pascal . Graphics on consoles / smartphones – What limitations are there in consoles or embedded systems vs the PC? How to overcome them compared to the PC approach? Tileable Textures – What methods are there for creating those? Manual vs procedural? Ray Tracing with RTX – What can be done with Nvidia's RTX cards? Occlusion Culling – How is this achieved? What data structures are used? Volumetric Rendering – How to simulate volumetric light transport? Fog , fire rendering? Facial Animations – How is it achieved? What are the modern, cheapest, professional solutions? Find more materials and ideas from the CGVR Lab's recommended literature list .
