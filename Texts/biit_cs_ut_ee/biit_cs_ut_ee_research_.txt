Research – BIIT Skip to content BIIT Bioinformatics, Algorithmics and Data Mining Group Menu and widgets Home People Research Software ELIXIR Publications Contact Meist meedias Coronavirus in Estonia Search Search for: Research Research Projects and Grants Our main research interests include analysis of biological and health data, omics data integration using machine learning, as well as the application of deep learning in the analysis of medical imaging. We specialize in developing software for biomedical research databases and e-health data management and analysis. We have dealt with various biological questions over the years, including cancer, stem cells, immunology, etc. Current Research Grants and Projects International: ELIXIR – Estonian representative and node representative ConnectedHealth – member PerkinElmer – Deep Learning for microscopy images BioEndoCar – EU project that aims to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for endometrium carcinoma (1.05.2018−01.04.2021), Main PI: Jaak Vilo CINECA – EU project that develops Common Infrastructure for National Cohorts in Europe, Canada, and Africa, Main PI: Kaur Alasoo EHDEN (IMI2) “European Health Data and Evidence Network” CONVERGE – EU project with the goal to standardise life science data management across Europe, Main PI: Hedi Peterson HealthyCloud – EU project developing strategic agenda including a ready-to-implement roadmap for the Health Research and Innovation Cloud ecosystem, Main PI: Hedi PEterson Estonian funding: RITA projekt: Masinõppe ja AI toega teenused (Machine learning and AI powered public services) GenMed “Implementing Personalised Medicine IT in Estonia” (ERF-TAT; 07.2019-31.12.2022), Main PI: Jaak Vilo PSG59 “ Computational analysis and learning from biological data (OmicNet) (1.01.2018−31.12.2020)”, Main PI: Hedi Peterson EXCITE TK148 “Estonian Centre of Excellence in ICT Research (1.09.2016−1.03.2023)”, Main PI: Jaak Vilo Biological Image Analysis: We develop and apply Deep Learning models for various image classification and segmentation tasks. People: Dmytro Fishman, Mikhail Papkov Collaborators: PerkinElmer , Leopold Parts Other ongoing collaborations: ETAIS – Estonian Scientific Computation Infrastructures HPC at University of Tartu Our main collaborations are based on those around the joint projects. These projects are also providing the main basis of the funding of the group. Additionally, we collaborate with friends and colleagues in the closely related interest areas – in genomics, omics integration, analysis of medical images, bioinformatics data warehousing, and mining. Our major local collaborators are Prof. Pärt Peterson, dr. Kai Kisand, prof. Ursel Soomets and Prof. Andres Salumets from the Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, dr. Lili Milani and Andres Metspalu from EGCUT,  prof. Külli Kingo from the University Hospital. We have also ongoing collaborations with local industry. Internationally we collaborate mostly with ELIXIR nodes on the infrastructure development and maintenance projects and enjoy research collaborations with many great researchers and institutions thanks to joint EU projects.
