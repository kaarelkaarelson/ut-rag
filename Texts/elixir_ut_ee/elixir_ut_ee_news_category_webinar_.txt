More researchers are writing code to process, analyse and visualise their data. For reproducible and robust research, it is increasingly important that this code is reviewed. Join this inaugural Open Science Coffee to learn more and discuss best practices, challenges and opportunities in reviewing research code.

The hackathon will be a practical online event to investigate gaps in the application of FAIR principles to project outputs and facilitate the implementation of FAIR approaches, where possible. The Hackathon will focus on cohort data, software tools including workflows, algorithms as well as web services, and training materials. The hackathon will be preceded by a âHow FAIR are youâ webinar series to provide background and introduce theoretical concepts that might be useful during the practical sessions. All participants are encouraged to attend or watch the recordings of the webinar series. The webinar topics include: Introduction to FAIR principles - Open science through FAIR health data networks: dream or reality? Making Cohort data FAIR FAIR Software tools Practically Fair How to make training FAIR Ethics/ELSI considerations - From FAIR to fair data sharing More information and registration is available at https://www.cineca-project.eu/news-events-all/how-fair-are-you-webinar-series-and-hackathon .
