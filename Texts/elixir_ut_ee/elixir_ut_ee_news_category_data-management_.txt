Iga tÃ¤ht FAIR-is viitab pÃµhimÃµtete (15)  loendile.  Kuigi FAIR pÃµhimÃµtted pÃ¤rinevad loodusteadustest, saab neid rakendada kÃµigis teadusvaldkondades. Alates nende avaldamisest on Euroopa Liit, riiklikud rahastajad ja Ã¼likoolid vÃ¤ljendanud nende pÃµhimÃµtete toetust ja heakskiitu. Ja olgem ausad, mÃµnda neist asjadest te teete ilmselt juba praegu. Sellel kursusel kÃ¤ime lÃ¤bi kÃµik FAIR pÃµhimÃµtted ja kuidas neid reaalses elus rakendatakse. Nii tead juba, mida taotluse kirjutamisel, oma andmehalduskava tÃ¤ites vÃµi oma uurimistÃ¶Ã¶d tehes arvesse vÃµtta.
