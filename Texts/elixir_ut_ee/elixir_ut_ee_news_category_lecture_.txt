The course will be held in English . All researchers will be handling some data at some point in their careers. However, the data, in its regular shape (tables), is quite hard to grasp for most people. Especially if there is a lot of it, this is where data visualization comes to help. The idea is to bring forth the essential aspects of the data - to tell a story. However, just putting data into a graph or figure might do more harm than good. Not only could it give wrong conclusions, but it also might be misleading. This is one of the main reasons why the exact way how you visualize the data is fundamental. This lecture is part of a series of lectures and workshops called âData visualisation.â The first lecture will discuss why data visualisation is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on. This lecture will be followed up by a workshop in May.

During the face-to-face workshop held in English we will do data visualisation using ggplot2 and Tableau. We will compare the user experience and the aesthetics of the results of both visualisation options. We will also put to use our knowledge of good practices in data visualisation we learned in the lecture.

This lecture will be a short overview of the FAIR principles and is part of a bigger data management course package aimed at DMP writers and grant applicants. In recent years, more attention has been put on what researchers do with the data they produce. Especially in Europe (think GDPR), but also everywhere else. The main idea is that when researchers use taxpayers' money, the taxpayers themselves should also have access to the results free of charge. This means that the research should be published in open-access journals, and data should be made publicly available. Good data management helps to make the whole process of making data reusable easier. In general, you should think about how to manage your data at the beginning and during the project and know what you plan to do with it at the end of the project. However, what is âgood data managementâ exactly is up for debate. The FAIR Principles concentrate on making your data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, so this is a good start. And letâs be honest, some of these things you probably are already doing. In this course, we will be going over all the FAIR Principles and how they are applied in real life. This way, you will already know what to consider while writing a grant, filling out your data management plan or doing your research.

The course will be held in English and will be held online . While doing scientific research, you handle different kinds of research outputs, whether they are produced by you or by somebody else. So, how can you ensure that other people will give you credit when using your produced materials? And how will you know how exactly you can use the resources produced by others? This is a topic that copyright laws handle. This lecture will cover what copyright laws do, who has the rights to the materials, and how you can use them. Most of this information is protected with licenses, whether they are meant for figures, data, or software. This lecture will discuss what licenses to use for different materials and what each license covers (this means how people can use the materials). We will also show how exactly you can apply a license to your research outputs.

This lecture will be held in English and will be held online . In general, metadata is the descriptive information about your data. However, what exactly is metadata, and how much of it should be included with your data? Good metadata can make up for human fallibilities. People forget and misplace things and leave research projects with their knowledge of the research methodology and the data. Metadata ensures that we will be able to find the data, use it, preserve and reuse it in the future. Finding Data : Metadata makes it much easier to find relevant data. Most searches are done using text (like a Google search), so formats like audio, images, and video are limited unless text metadata is available. Metadata also makes text documents easier to find because it explains exactly what the document is about. Using Data : To use a dataset, researchers need to understand how the data is structured, the definitions of terms used, how it was collected, and how it should be read. Reusing Data : Researchers often want to reuse data collected for another project for their own project. The data still needs to be found and used, but often at a higher level of trust and understanding. Reusing data usually requires careful preservation and documentation of the metadata. This means that the metadata provides additional information that helps data consumers better to understand the meaning and the structure of the dataset and to clarify other issues, such as rights and license terms, the organization that generated the data, data quality, data access methods, and the update schedule of datasets. Additionally, metadata also gives information about the data in general. What an actual metadata file includes varies between disciplines and types of data you are working with. However, the documentation for your data should contain the minimum information required to be able to reuse (or understand) the data described. In the lecture, we will be going over what exactly metadata is, the minimum information that should be included with each of the scientific results you are sharing, and how exactly you can write a README file.

This lecture is part of a bigger data management course package aimed at DMP writers and grant applicants. In the first part of the course, data librarian Tiiu Tarkpea will give an overview of the Open Science movement in Estonia. The objective of Open Science is to make research open, global, creative and cooperation-based by using modern e-infrastructures. In the second part, Tiiu will introduce the DMPonline tool to create your Data Management Plan. DMPonline helps you to create, review, and share data management plans that meet institutional and funder requirements. In the third part, Grant Office will go over frequent problems when applying for grants and will answer some questions.
