As a general rule these high performance computer resources use Linux operating systems and are accessible only by a shell terminal. This course is aimed to provide basic survival skills in Linux and terminal environment. We will teach you how to access files and folders, move around and hopefully shake off the fear of getting stuck somewhere along the way.

But what exactly is data management and what can you do to ensure that youâre managing your data well? In this mini workshop you will learn what to consider when managing life science data and gain hints and tips for submitting your data to a public resource. Dr. Melissa Burke and Dr. Sarah Morgan from EMBL-EBI training team ( see more about them ) will share best practicies, trips and tricks about managing your scientific data. Registration and participation is free of charge. Up to 20 participants can take part. Please register here . The workshop will take place at Ãlikooli 17 (Paabel) on 13th of December at 9:30â12:30.

The major event is ELIXIR Information Day that takes place on 14th of December 2018 at Hotel Lydia Conference Center in Tartu. The day starts with welcoming coffee at 9am and finishes with drinks session around 4pm. The event is free of charge for all registered participants. The info day will give researchers from academia and industry, funders, decision makers and wider public an overview what ELIXIR is how it serves the scientific community. Presenters include: Dr. Mateusz Kuzak (DTL; ELIXIR-Neatherlands), Dr. Ilkka Lappalainen (CSC; ELIXIR-Finland), Dr. Sarah Morgan (EMBL-EBI), Dr. Ulvi Gerst-Talas (TÃ; ELIXIR-Estonia; ETAIS), Dr. Hedi Peterson (TÃ; ELIXIR-Estonia), Prof. Jaak Vilo (TÃ; ELIXIR-Estonia). Learn more about the presenters here. The purpose of ELIXIR is to construct and operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to support life science research and its translation to medicine and the environment, the bio-industries and society . These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers. The goal of ELIXIR is to coordinate these resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure . This coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share data , analyse their experiments , exchange knowledge , and agree on best practices . Estonian ELIXIR Node The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software tools and databases , linking of bioinformatics and biobanking , and last but not least, training researchers across borders . ELIXIR Information Day is a day full of opportunities to learn how ELIXIR can be beneficial to researchers' every day task.

This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools (including basic programming) for working more effectively with data. We will cover Data organization in spreadsheets and OpenRefine, Introduction to R, Data analysis and visualization in R. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
