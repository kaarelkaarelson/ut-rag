First, we will cover spreadsheet best practices. Then, we will put that knowledge into practice with OpenRefine. This course will explore the depths of OpenRefine software and see what it can offer. This will include cleaning the data in bigger batches and unifying the data in one sweep (transforms and expressions). Additionally, we will introduce the possibility of downloading additional data from other databases and different extensions OpenRefine software has. Learning outcomes for the participants: Describe spreadsheet best practices Compare Excel and OpenRefine Apply transforms (cell editing, column editing, transposing) in OpenRefine Write simple expressions in OpenRefine Match your dataset with that of an external source We ask you to register responsibly.

It is employed by professionals to monitor their progress and collaborate effectively. Its utility extends beyond software development; it can be used for books, papers, small datasets, or any evolving content that requires sharing. Git is a globally adopted tool that helps developers manage changes in collaborative projects. Keeping a record of changes, complete with timestamps and explanations, becomes exceptionally valuable when returning to a project in the future, like a year later when recollection may be unclear. Learning outcomes for the participants: Describe the importance of version control Create a repository in Git Track changes and collaborate in Git Solve conflicts in Git We ask you to register responsibly.

September 11, 2023 in Data visualisation , charts 2 min read Data visualisation - 9.11.2023 Time: 9.11.2023 10:00-12:00 Type: Zoom (link will be sent a few days before the webinar) Language: English Duration: 2h Location: Online Audience: students, researchers Speaker: Diana Pilvar, MSc In the course of their work, researchers encounter data in various forms. Yet, when data is presented in its raw, tabular form, it often appears as a complex puzzle. This can be especially overwhelming when dealing with large datasets. Fortunately, this is where the magic of data visualization comes into play. The main idea is to extract the key insights from the data and craft a narrative around it. However, it's important to note that hasty chart-making can lead to confusion. Poorly designed visuals not only risk misinterpretation but can also be misleading. That's why it's crucial to approach data visualization thoughtfully and precisely. This webinar will discuss why data visualisation is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on. The webinar will have a theoretical aspect, and we will assess examples from real life. This lecture will be followed up by a separate workshop on the 14th of November called âRStudio Visualisation ,â where you can put your knowledge into practice. Learning outcomes for the participants: Choose appropriate chart types Avoid common mistakes in data visualisation Maximise data-ink ratio We ask you to register responsibly.
