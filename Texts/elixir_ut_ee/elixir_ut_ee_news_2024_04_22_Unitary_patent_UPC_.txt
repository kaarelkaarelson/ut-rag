However, the value of patenting for the development of innovation cannot be underestimated, so it is not surprising that the EPO introduced a new patenting system, including new type of patent and Patent Court that should make obtaining a patent easier and cheaper, freeing bright minds from unnecessary bureaucracy. The seminar will reveal the true impact of a simplified system on patenting strategy, as well as provide practical advice on its use. Date: 09.
