This course is addressed to life scientists, bioinformaticians and researchers who are familiar with writing Python code and core Python elements and would like to explore if further in their daily data wrangling and exploration tasks. Registration deadline: 08 May 2024 More Info and Registration General information Time: 16 May 2024 9:00-17:00 CEST Registration deadline: 08 May 2024 Location: Online Fees: Academic: 100 CHF For-profit: 500 CHF Materials: https://github.com/sib-swiss/intermediate-python-training Description Python is an open-source and general-purpose scripting language which runs on all major operating systems. It was designed to be easily read and written with comparatively simple syntax. Over the recent years Python has become a programming language of choice for bioinformatics and data analysis, and in particular for applications that make use of machine learning or deep learning. However, these applications usually require a good mastering of a few modules (such as numpy, or pandas) that can go beyond basic Python commands. This 1-day course will introduce modules and recipes to unlock the potential of Python for day-to-day data exploration and analysis of real-life datasets. Topics that will be covered in this course include: Parsing, transforming, and exporting data using pandas Exploring data, and creating useful summaries using pandas and numpy Representing data in an efficient and impactful manner using seaborn Learning outcomes At the end of this course, participants are expected to: Parse any tabulated data set in a couple of lines Summarize and perform quality control on their data Filter, sub-sample or aggregate specific parts of their dataset(s) Generate clear visual representations to explore data and communicate their findings Prerequisites Test your skills with Python and statistics with the quiz here , before registering. We recommend 4 out of 6 correct answers. You are required to use your own laptop, with a recent Python 3 version. Please make sure you have install Anaconda, Jupyter notebook and the needed Python librairies on your personal laptop before the start of the course.
