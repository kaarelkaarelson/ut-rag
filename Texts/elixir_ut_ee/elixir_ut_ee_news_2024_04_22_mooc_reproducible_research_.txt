Enrollment:  Apr 02, 2024 to Sep 04, 2024 Course:  May 16, 2024 to Sep 12, 2024 More Info and Registration General information Time: From May 16, 2024 to Sep 12, 2024 Registration deadline: From Apr 02, 2024 to Sep 04, 2024 Location: Online Effort: 35 hours Description We will show you how to improve your practices for managing large data and complex computations in controlled software environments: you will learn how to use formats like JSON, FITS, and HDF5, platforms like Zenodo and Software Heritage, tools like git-annex, docker, singularity, guix, make, and snakemake; we will show you how to integrate them in a real-life use case: a sunspot detection study. You will see for yourself that our methods and tools allow you to work in a reliable and reproducible way. The strength of this new MOOC lies in a general and systematic presentation of the major concepts and of how they translate into practical solutions through numerous hands-on sessions with state-of-the-art open-source tools. Learning outcomes At the end of this course, you will be able to: Manage research data: understand the challenges posed by large volumes of data archive data on well-known archives such as Software Heritage and Zenodo integrate data into versioning (Git Annex) use structured binary data formats (FITS, HDF5) Use tools and techniques for controlling the software environment: understand how software packages are built and managed deploy software environments as containers (ex: Docker) manage software environments using a functional package manager (ex: Guix) work in controlled software environments on a daily basis Automate long or complex computations using workflows: understand the challenges of scaling up: long calculations, distributed calculations choose a workflow tool adapted to your needs automate a data analysis using make and snakemake control the software environments of a workflow Prerequisites This course is for everyone who relies on a computer to perform data analysis. You should have some experience with running commands in a terminal, and have a basic knowledge of git and scientific Python.
