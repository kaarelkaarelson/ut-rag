Yet, when data is presented in its raw, tabular form, it often appears as a complex puzzle. This can be especially overwhelming when dealing with large datasets. Fortunately, this is where the magic of data visualization comes into play. The main idea is to extract the key insights from the data and craft a narrative around it. However, it's important to note that hasty chart-making can lead to confusion. Poorly designed visuals not only risk misinterpretation but can also be misleading. That's why it's crucial to approach data visualization thoughtfully and precisely. This webinar will discuss why data visualisation is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on. The webinar will have a theoretical aspect, and we will assess examples from real life. This lecture will be followed up by a separate workshop on the 14th of November called âRStudio Visualisation ,â where you can put your knowledge into practice. Learning outcomes for the participants: Choose appropriate chart types Avoid common mistakes in data visualisation Maximise data-ink ratio We ask you to register responsibly.

The course will be held in English . All researchers will be handling some data at some point in their careers. However, the data, in its regular shape (tables), is quite hard to grasp for most people. Especially if there is a lot of it, this is where data visualization comes to help. The idea is to bring forth the essential aspects of the data - to tell a story. However, just putting data into a graph or figure might do more harm than good. Not only could it give wrong conclusions, but it also might be misleading. This is one of the main reasons why the exact way how you visualize the data is fundamental. This lecture is part of a series of lectures and workshops called âData visualisation.â The first lecture will discuss why data visualisation is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on. This lecture will be followed up by a workshop in May.
