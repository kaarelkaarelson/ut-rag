This webinar is suitable for those interested in studying the microbiomes of any environment or host. Although the presentation will be focused on the human microbiome, the methods and techniques discussed will also be applicable to other microbial ecosystems. No prior knowledge of bioinformatics is required, but undergraduate level knowledge of biology would be useful.

Nextflow is renowned for its robust, scalable, and reproducible methods of running computational pipelines. Through efficient, interactive lessons, participants will gain a solid understanding of Nextflow technology, from fundamental to advanced concepts. Continue reading January 29, 2024 in workshop , bioinformatics , enrichment-analysis 2 min read Online course: Enrichment Analysis Experiments designed to quantify gene expression often yield hundreds of genes that show statistically significant differences between groups of interest. Once differentially expressed genes are identified, enrichment analysis (EA) methods can be used to explore the biological functions associated with these genes. EA methods allow us to identify groups of genes (e.g. particular pathways) that are over-represented, thereby offering insights into biological mechanisms. One of the EA methods frequently used for high-throughput gene expression data analysis is Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). This course will cover GSEA and alternative enrichment methods. Because the implementation of GSEA is directly linked to databases that annotate the function of genes in a cell, the course will also give an overview of functional annotation databases such as Gene Ontology.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are very powerful for the detection of genomic variants. Thanks to its throughput and cost-efficiency it enables the detection of a large number of variants in a large number of samples. In this two-day course we will cover the steps from read alignment to variant calling and annotation. We will mainly focus on the detection of germline mutations by following the GATK best practices.

This course covers the basic concepts and methods required for RNA-seq analysis. Particular attention is given to the data analysis pipelines for differential transcript expression and variant calling. The course consists of a mixture of lectures and Galaxy, Linux and R practicals. Also the potential of long-read based RNA-seq and AI based analysis enrichments will be explored.

For example, scRNAseq can help to identify expression patterns that differ between conditions within a cell-type. To generate and analyze scRNAseq data, several methods are available, all with their strengths and weaknesses depending on the researchersâ needs. This 3-day course will cover the main technologies as well as the main aspects to consider while designing a scRNAseq experiment. In addition, it will cover the theoretical background of analysis methods with hands-on practical data analysis sessions applied to droplet-based methods.

This course provides an introduction to the use of bioinformatics in biological research, giving participants guidance for using bioinformatics in their work whilst also providing hands-on training in tools and resources appropriate to their research. Participants will initially be introduced to bioinformatics theory and practice, including best practices for undertaking bioinformatics analysis, data management, and reproducibility. To enable specific exploration of resources in their particular field of interest, participants will then be divided into focused groups to work on a project. Participants will be required to review some pre-recorded material prior to the start of the course. Information about the summer school Date : 12 - 16 June 2023 Application deadline : 05 March 2023 Cost : Â£825.00 inclusive of four nights accommodation and catering, including dinner Participant limit : Open application with selection 30 places More info : https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/summer-school-bioinformatics-0/ Group projects : Genome variation across human populations Interpreting functional information from large scale protein structure data Modelling cell signalling pathways Networks and pathways Reusing FAIR Bioimage data: an AI application Who is this course for? Applicants are expected to be at an early stage of using bioinformatics in their research with the need to develop their knowledge and skills further. No previous knowledge of programming is required for this course; group projects may give you the opportunity to learn basic programming, but participants will be supported in this by their mentors. Depending on your chosen project, an introductory programming tutorial may be given as homework prior to attending the course. Learning outcomes After this course you should be able to: Discuss applications of bioinformatics in biological research Browse, search, and retrieve biological data from public repositories Use appropriate bioinformatics tools to explore biological data Describe ways that biological data can be stored, organised and integrated 1 2 Back to top ELIXIR Estonia ServicesÂ Terms of Use .
