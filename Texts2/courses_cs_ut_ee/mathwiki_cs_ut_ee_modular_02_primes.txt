These divisors are $1$, which divides all natural numbers, and the number $n$ itself. Anyone can easily recall some smallest prime numbers, e.g., $2,3,5,7,11,13,17$ etc. Although in general, determining whether a given (large) number is prime can be a very resource consuming. Also, the location of primes among integers can not be easily computed, however there are many interesting patters, see e.g. Ulam spiral and Prime number theorem . Show that the set of prima numbers is infinite. Hint. Start by assuming that the set of prime numbers is finite, for example $\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}$. Solution Let us denote with $\mathbb{P}$ the set of prime numbers. Assume the opposite: the set $\mathbb{P}$ is finite and $\mathbb{P}=\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}$, where $p_1<p_2<\cdots<p_n$. Let $q=p_1p_2\cdots p_n+1$. As $q>p_n$, the number $q$ must have more then two divisors. Moreover, it must be divisible by some prime number — there exists $i$, such that $p_i\mid q$. But we also have $p_i\mid p_1p_2\cdots p_n=q-1$ because this product contains $p_i$. Hence $p_i\mid q-(q-1)=1$ implying that $p_i=1$, which is a contradiction because $1$ is not a prime number. A natural number is composite if it has more than two divisors. Note that $1$ is not considered a prime number nor a composite number as it only has one divisor. In a way, the prime numbers are the ``building blocks'' of all natural numbers (see the following theorem). Unique factorization theorem. Any natural number $n$ can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime numbers:
$$n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}\cdot \dots \cdot p_k^{e_k}   = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i},$$
where $p_k$ is the largest prime number that divides $n$ and $e_i \in\mathbb{N}\cup\{ 0\}$ for all $i\in\{1,\dots,k\}$. Here we denote $p_1 = 2$, $p_2 = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, $p_4 = 7$, $p_5 = 11$, etc. Thus, $p_i$ denote the i-th prime number. For any $i$, the integer $e_i$ is called the index of $n$ at $p_i$ . Some examples of the prime factorization: $30=2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1$, $24=2^3 \cdot 3^1$, $3675=2^0 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2 $. Note that there can be primes $p_i$ which do not divide $n$ and thus their power $e_i=0$ written to the end of the prime factorisation if needed. Find the prime factorisations of $4$, $36$, $720$. Answer $4=2^2$, $36=2^2 \cdot 3^2$, $720=2^4 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^1$ The prime factorisations are very tightly related to the divisibility relation. Given two natural numbers $n$ and $m$ as their prime factorizations $n = p_1^{e_1}\cdot\dots\cdot p_k^{e_k}$
and $m = p_1^{e'_1}\cdot\dots\cdot p_l^{e'_l}$, it is clear that
$n \mid m$ if and only if $e_i \leq e'_i$ for all $i \in \{1,\dots,\max\{k,l\}\}$. For example, $24\not\mid 30$, where $24=2^{\color{blue}3} \cdot 3^{\color{blue}1}$, $30=2^{\color{red}1} \cdot 3^{\color{red}1} \cdot 5^{\color{red}1}$, since for the prime $2$ the required relation between the powers does not hold primes $2$ $3$ $5$ relation betveen powers $\color{blue}3\not\leq \color{red}1$ $\color{blue}1\leq \color{red}1$ $\color{blue}0\leq \color{red}1$ However, $10\mid 30$, where $10=2^{\color{blue}1} \cdot 3^{\color{blue}0}\cdot 5^{\color{blue}1}$, $30=2^{\color{red}1} \cdot 3^{\color{red}1} \cdot 5^{\color{red}1}$, since primes $2$ $3$ $5$ relation betveen powers $\color{blue}1\leq \color{red}1$ $\color{blue}0\leq \color{red}1$ $\color{blue}1\leq \color{red}1$ Use prime factorisation to verify $465 \mid 6975$. Solution Since $465=2^0\cdot 3^1\cdot 5^1\cdot 7^0\cdot 11^0\cdot 13^0\cdot 17^0\cdot 19^0\cdot 23^0\cdot 29^0\cdot 31^1$ and $6975=2^0\cdot 3^2\cdot 5^2\cdot 7^0\cdot 11^0\cdot 13^0\cdot 17^0\cdot 19^0\cdot 23^0\cdot 29^0\cdot 31^1$. Indeed, $465 \mid 6975$. This relation between the prime factorisation and divisibility can be used for calculating the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple.
