You can also click on the documentation index button to search for some specific formatting you can not find from the common list. Here are some extra tips you can do when creating your project pages. Images Images are very important on your project pages. These convey your project more efficiently than words. Images of your project, your architecture models, brainstorming results etc. are all good. However, the images need to be balanced out in the text. They should not be too big or small compared to the rest of the page content. Also, embed your images on the page instead of only linking to them in the text! Before uploading and embedding an image, be sure that your image is not unnecessarily huge. First make sure that the resolution is at maximum about 900px for the longest edge. If your image has bigger resolution, then it likely takes up too much unnecessary bandwidth. Everyone has to wait until your big image (which is actually resampled by the browser anyway) loads.
Secondly, be sure you know your file formats: format description usage PNG Small and medium size pictures with a small color palette. Transparency. Keeps straight edges. Use for small images or if you have a game with sprites and little or no shading. Also if you have sharp detail you want to preserve (incl graphs and plots). JPEG Medium and large size pictures with a large color palette. Usually photos. Use compression with quality at least 85-90%. Use if your game has shading and the screenshot has a large amount of different pixel colors. Or if you have a photograph. GIF Short animations with a small color palette. Be sure to optimize the GIF-s color map to save space and not lose any of your colors. The only reason to use that is if you have an animated GIF. In any other case PNG is better. And even then, if the animation is long and includes many colors, then a video would be better. Generally, any image you embed should not exceed 1 MB. If you need a high-res image, then have a link to it and embed only a low-res version of it. You can also put images next to your text. This is useful if your images are vertical. Usually you should try to avoid too vertical images as the project page is also vertical an thus the images takes up a lot of room on the page. However, sometimes the object on the image is actually vertical and then it might be a good idea to make the image smaller and put it next to the paragraph talking about that image. The above is achieved with the following: %rfloat width=100% Attach:Main/ProjectPageHelpImage-2.png

[[<<]] The percent sign after the width=100 indicates the end of a definition. The image is resized to have a width of 100 pixels. Also be sure your image embeds are always on their own separate text row. If you put an image embed to the same line as your content text, then the result will be ugly. Of course you can also put many images in one row. Of course you can also put many images in one row.

A very easy way to include videos to your page is to upload them to YouTube . You can make your videos unlisted there, so that they will not show up on your profile if you do not want that. Then to put a video here, just paste a link to the video into a new line: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lk_qAgHkw?height=360&width=614 Toggle When you are writing sections of your page, then you might want to include a toggle buttons to collapse the sections and allow the user open them if they want to.
