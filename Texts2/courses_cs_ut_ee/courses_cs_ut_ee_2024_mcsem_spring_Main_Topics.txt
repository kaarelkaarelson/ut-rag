A theme of interest here is analysing, predicting how the inhabitants of a city move about, as this helps make better decisions to avoid traffic congestion, etc. RQ: How to manage the fact that sensors cannot observe 100% of mobility events in a city? RQ: How far ahead can predicitons about mobility be made, what influences this? RQ: How to determine the "weak link" data sources in sensor fusion?

The edge devices are equipped with a limited computing capacity. When we talk about edge computing, we need to think about the characteristics of edge data, edge resources, edge devices and many more. On the other hand clustering strategies in IoT and wireless communications are applied mostly to reduce the energy consumption and further improve the network resource utilisation. In this topic, the student needs to go through the algorithms/strategies that are specifically designed for clustering the edge data or the devices or the users. The student need to answer following: What are clustering algorithms present in computer science, e.g. K-Means, Affinity Propagation (AP), Mean-shift, Spectral clustering, etc. ? The general working principles of some (2-3) popular clustering algorithms? Comparison of clustering algorithms? (features, applicability, limitations, advantages, are they lightweight, scalability, reliability, adaptive and dynamic, etc,) Some articles to start investigating: Clustering Algorithms on Low-Power and High-Performance Devices for Edge Computing Environments, https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/16/5395 Task Classification and Scheduling Based on K-Means Clustering for Edge Computing, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-020-07343-w A Comprehensive Survey of Clustering Algorithms, https://doi.org/10.1007/s40745-015-0040-1 C2: Evolution of Abstraction and its role in edge-cloud continuum The evolution of abstraction in computer science is a fascinating journey that has played a major role in the advancement of computing paradigms. Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by isolating relevant details while hiding unnecessary complexities. It has evolved over the years, enabling programmers and computer scientists to work at higher levels of understanding and productivity.

Generative AI models learn from a dataset and then generate new data samples that exhibit patterns and characteristics present in the training data. Generative AI can be applied in cloud infrastructure automation to enhance various aspects of cloud management and operations, including resource provisioning and scaling, cost optimization, security and anomaly detection, infrastructure configuration management, predictive maintenance.

- Splunk This topic would focus on the Discoverability and Observability aspects of edge computing infrastructure (including edge intelligence, edge knowledge, IoT data, edge services, edge devices, etc). Some of the precise questions, the student needs to focus are: Q: What is the difference between Discoverability and Observability in general? Q: What can be made discoverable and observable in edge computing? Q: How do you see these two terms in the context of Edge computing? Some resources to start with: Discovery systems in ubiquitous computing ( https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.utlib.ut.ee/document/1626210 ) Edge-to-Edge Resource Discovery using Metadata Replication ( https://zenodo.org/record/5851025/files/27.pdf ) C6: X Discovery: A short survey Discoverability mechanism lets an entity X on a network be discoverable. The entity X can be a service, a device, a network or knowledge. For instance, the service discovery protocol is used by a client device to find out about the services it can use on a server device. On the other hand, edge computing allows the IoT device generated data or client data to be processed by the nearest computing device present at the periphery of the network. This topic would focus on the study of discovery systems in edge computing, especially the study of device, service, and knowledge discovery at the edge. Some of the questions the student need to focus on, are: What do you mean by X discoverability? How the X discovery works at the edge, where X can be device, service, or knowledge?

In these contexts, there is a growing emphasis on processing data in close proximity to the source devices to enable faster decision-making. The concept revolves around utilizing nearby servers to execute Machine Learning algorithms. However, these algorithms demand significant memory and CPU resources for both training and execution, which presents a challenge when dealing with devices that have limited resources. Conversely, a collection of methods and tools is designed to address this challenge, facilitating the creation of memory and CPU-efficient ML models that can seamlessly integrate into diverse embedded system architectures. One noteworthy platform within this landscape is tinyML. Hence, the primary objective of this investigation is to explore the tinyML framework or toolkit, specifically tailored for the development of Machine Learning applications that prioritize edge computing.
