Solving systems of linear equations via invertible matrices Number theory Probability theory Event and probability Probability of two events Conditional probability Total probability Expected value Inequalities Game notation Asymptotics In this topic we will learn how to compare the performance of algorithms on large inputs using asymptotic notations — the Big Oh and the Big Omega . In our examples, we will mainly deal with 
running times of algorithms (so-called time complexity ); analogously one can analyze memory usage 
(so-called space complexity ), too. We will also investigate how the success probability of an algorithm 
can depend on input size or security parameters using the concepts negligible , overwhelming and noticeable .
