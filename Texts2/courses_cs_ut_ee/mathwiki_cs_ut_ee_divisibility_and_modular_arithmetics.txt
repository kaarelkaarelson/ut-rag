Long division of polynomials The general way of constructing finite fields Isomorphisms, homomorphisms, automorphisms. Classification of all finite fields Computations in finite fields What is a group? Multiplicative group in finite fields Subfields Linear algebra 1. Matrices 2. Systems of linear equations and matrices 3. Gaussian elimination algorithm 4. Solving systems of linear equations via invertible matrices Number theory Probability theory Event and probability Probability of two events Conditional probability Total probability Expected value Inequalities Game notation Divisibility and modular arithmetics A lot of cryptography constructions are built on top of various algebraic structures. All this structures are ultimately built on top of integers $\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}$. In the following lessons we will recall and study some more important aspects of integers.
