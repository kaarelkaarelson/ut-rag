You must also have previously registered for one of the regular exams (i.e., exam 1 or 2). - Special rules apply for students participating in the EDF exercises scheduled during the 2nd half of May. Note: The exam duration is 100 min!  In order to get started in time, please arrive a few minutes before the exam starts. More information about the exam can be found in the Assessment and Grades section. Components of course grade: Active participation in labs and associated assignments/reports (homework) - work individually or in pairs (60% of course grade) Quizzes - individual (10% of course grade) Participation in final exam - individual (30% of course grade) Admission requirements for exam: You must have at least 33% of the maximum possible marks of the homework assignments. You must be registered for the exam that you wish to take. How plagiarism and cheating is handled: Since 60% of the final grade depends on the homework assignments, it is important that you solve the homework problems independently. If we have a suspicion that complete solutions of homework assignments have been passed on to other students and then largely copied, then we inform you and allow you to clarify the issue in writing and in a follow-up face-to-face meeting. If you have passed on your work to course mates or you copied from your course mates' work, you will get a penalty. In addition, you will be reported to the Vice Dean Academic Affairs. This procedure applies also in the case of cheating during the final exam.
