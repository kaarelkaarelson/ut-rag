The researchers found that 2048-bit RSA key can be factored in only 140.8 CPU-years in the worst case scenario. The algorithm turned out to be used by 750 000 Estonian ID-cards. In this thesis, we implemented the ROCA attack and, based on the properties observed from the keys generated by the affected smartcards, found further optimizations which allow to improve the  original attack from 140.8 CPU-years to 35.2 CPU-years for 90% of the keys and 70.4 CPU-years for the remaining 10% of the keys. As additional contribution, we provide a parallelized version of the attack that can be executed on an HPC.
