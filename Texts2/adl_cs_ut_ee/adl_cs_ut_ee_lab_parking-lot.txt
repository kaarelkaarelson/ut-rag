Parking lot — Autonomous Driving Lab Autonomous Driving Lab Discover ADL The Lab Research Teaching Blog The Lab Making cars drive by themselves means that we absolutely must play with all the impressive equipment at our disposal. Take a look at what we’re working with! Vehicle Software Simulation Parking lot Demo track Parking lot Once we’ve put a new and untried piece of self-driving tech through its paces in the simulated environment , we’re confident enough to undertake experiments with the real car in the real world. But before we proceed to the actual streets of Tartu that make up our demo track , we do closed testing on the huge parking lot of the Estonian National Museum that is conveniently close to us. There we can shift around the HD map of the actual demo track on top of the flat surface of the parking lot, so that we can go through all sections and junctions of the demo track, step-by-step, in a physical but safe environment. Here are examples of some successful and some not so successful obstacle detection tests in this parking lot. Location Pay a visit to our testing grounds. While there, we also recommend the excellent Estonian National Museum! See the map Click on "Show map" to accept Google's privacy policy and see the map.
