Kull – Machine Learning research group | Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu Skip to content Machine Learning research group | Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu Menu Home About Kull Meelis Kull I’m an associate professor in machine learning, leading the machine learning research group at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Estonia. I am also an honorary senior research associate at the University of Bristol, UK. My research interests are machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science, with a focus on uncertainty quantification and trustworthiness. I enjoy theoretical research with a clear path to applications and my work is primarily on the statistical side of machine learning.
