Do you write software to analyze data or implement in-silico models as part of your daily work? Do you write scientific publications based on software you created yourself but do not know what unit testing, refactoring or version control are? Are you writing code that you find hard to understand some weeks later? Do you have thousands of lines of code, but no automated way of verifying that the code works correctly? Do you find yourself regularly using âcopy & pasteâ to re-use code you wrote earlier? Do small changes in your code later cause trouble in other unexpected places?

However, the value of patenting for the development of innovation cannot be underestimated, so it is not surprising that the EPO introduced a new patenting system, including new type of patent and Patent Court that should make obtaining a patent easier and cheaper, freeing bright minds from unnecessary bureaucracy. The seminar will reveal the true impact of a simplified system on patenting strategy, as well as provide practical advice on its use. Date: 09.
