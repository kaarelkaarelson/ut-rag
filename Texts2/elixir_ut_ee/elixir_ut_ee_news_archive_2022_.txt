The course will be held in English. When handling any kind of information that may help to identify a person, whether directly or indirectly, it must be handled with care. Particular attention should be put to collecting, processing, handling, and storing the data throughout the research process. This is meant for both textual, but also audio, video, and picture data. However, what does this mean for the researcher? In this lecture, we will go over what GDPR and the Estonian Personal Data Protection Act say when dealing with personal data. Also, we will concentrate on what it means for the researcher working with this data and what he/she/they need to do to abide by these laws. This lecture will also cover the consent form and anonymization/pseudonymization processes.

The course will be held in English. All researchers will be handling some data at some point in their careers. However, the data, in its regular shape (tables), is quite hard to grasp for most people. Especially if there is a lot of it, this is where data visualization comes to help. The idea is to bring forth the essential aspects of the data - to tell a story. However, just putting data into a graph or figure might do more harm than good. Not only could it give wrong conclusions, but it also might be misleading. This is one of the main reasons why the exact way how you visualize the data is fundamental. This lecture is part of a series of lectures and workshops called âData visualization.â The first lecture will discuss why data visualization is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on.

The course will be held in English. This course will be in two parts: a 1.5-hour online lecture on how to make a spreadsheet usable for other people held on the 4th of October at 10:00 in Zoom. The practical workshop on cleaning your messy data with OpenRefine software will be a video lecture you can follow in your own time. Additionally, we will hold 2 Q&A sessions in Zoom, where you can talk about any problems you encountered with the OpenRefine software. This course will cover how to name your files and variables, version control, compile a data dictionary, and what to do with empty cells. In the second part of this lecture, OpenRefine software is introduced. With this, you can easily clean up the messy data. For the more practical aspect of using the OpenRefine software, we will share a video that will teach the basics. You can watch it anytime and do the lessons yourself. On two days (7.10 and 10.10), there will be a 1h slot (10:00-11:00) on Zoom, when you can come and ask any question you have regarding tables and OpenRefine software.

The course will be held in English. While doing scientific research, you handle different kinds of research outputs, whether they are produced by you or by somebody else. So, how can you ensure that other people will give you credit when using your produced materials? And how will you know how exactly you can use the resources produced by others? This is a topic that copyright laws handle. This lecture will cover what copyright laws do, who has the rights to the materials, and how you can use them. Most of this information is protected with licenses, whether they are meant for figures, data, or software. This lecture will discuss what licenses to use for different materials and what each license covers (this means how people can use the materials). We will also show how exactly you can apply a license to your research outputs.

This lecture will be held in English. In general, metadata is the descriptive information about your data. However, what exactly is metadata, and how much of it should be included with your data? Good metadata can make up for human fallibilities. People forget and misplace things and leave research projects with their knowledge of the research methodology and the data. Metadata ensures that we will be able to find the data, use it, preserve and reuse it in the future. Finding Data: Metadata makes it much easier to find relevant data. Most searches are done using text (like a Google search), so formats like audio, images, and video are limited unless text metadata is available. Metadata also makes text documents easier to find because it explains exactly what the document is about. Using Data: To use a dataset, researchers need to understand how the data is structured, definitions of terms used, how it was collected, and how it should be read. Reusing Data: Researchers often want to reuse data collected for another project for their own project. The data still needs to be found and used, but often at a higher level of trust and understanding. Reusing data usually requires careful preservation and documentation of the metadata. This means that the metadata provides additional information that helps data consumers better to understand the meaning and the structure of the dataset and to clarify other issues, such as rights and license terms, the organization that generated the data, data quality, data access methods, and the update schedule of datasets. Additionally, metadata also gives information about the data in general. What an actual metadata file includes varies between disciplines and types of data you are working with. However, the documentation for your data should contain the minimum information required to be able to reuse (or understand) the data described. In the lecture, we will be going over what exactly metadata is, the minimum information that should be included with each of the scientific results you are sharing, and how exactly you can write a README file.

May 11, 2022 2 min read “Bring Your Own Data Management Planâ workshop - Invitations only According to the Estonian Research Council funding agreement, all the projects that have started from 2022 have to submit a data management plan (DMP) within the first 6 months. Since this will be a new thing for a lot of researchers, University of Tartu, University of Tartu Library,  ELIXIR Estonia and The Estonian Research Council will be doing a data management writing course for this purpose. This workshop will be with invitations only. âBring Your Own Data Management Planâ workshop (in English) will consist of two sessions: one online introduction and one face-to-face writing session. The writing sessions will be held both in Tartu and in Tallinn. The online session will be held 20th of May at 11:00 - 14:30, with one 15 min break in between the sessions. Within this time, Tiiu Tarkpea will give an overview of Open Science in Estonia. We have also invited people from the Estonian Research Council, so they can answer your questions in person. Additionally, there are also two DMP writing tool introductions: DMPonline by Tiiu Tarkpea (University of Tartu Library) and Data Stewardship Wizard by Federico Bianchini (ELIXIR Norway). After that you can pick from two face-to-face sessions, in case you need any help with the writing of the DMP part (participation not mandatory). The 26th of May (14:00-17:00) session will be held in Tartu and the 6th of June (14:00-17:00) session will be held at Tallinn (the precise location will be sent with an email). In this, we will be talking about the theory of different aspects of the DMP, giving more practical advice  and there will be two 1h writing sessions, where you can write most of your DMP. Also, if you have any questions, the organizers (Tiiu Tarkpea and Heleri Inno) will help as best as they can. The registration information should arrive through the Grant Office, via invitations only. In case of questions, you can contact ELIXIR Estonia (elixir@ut.ee).

The event will take place on 18-19 May 2022 from 09:00-13:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time). The meeting is organised by members of ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Estonia, and SciLifeLab Data Centre. The current COVID-19 pandemic has understandably received considerable attention worldwide over the last few years. As it spread across the globe, the pandemic posed significant challenges for society, governmental bodies, healthcare systems, and research communities. Unprecedented efforts were necessary to generate, handle, and report the sheer amount of complex data required to be able to understand how SARS-CoV-2 was spreading, and develop efficient policies to fight the pandemic. I n this online event, we will focus on how the Nordic region handled omics data. We will focus in particular on how sequencing efforts were coordinated, how data was managed and shared, and how data was used and communicated to different groups. We will also discuss the importance of the FAIR principles in pandemic data management, and which tools and pipelines facilitated efforts. We also hope to identify key resources that have wider applicability and can be reused further.
