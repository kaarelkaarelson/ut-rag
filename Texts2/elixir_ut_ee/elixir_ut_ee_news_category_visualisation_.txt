Using different datasets, we will practice quality control, alignment of reads to a reference genome and visualize the output. This course is intended for life scientists who are already dealing with NGS data and would like to be able to start analysing them.

The course will be held in English . All researchers will be handling some data at some point in their careers. However, the data, in its regular shape (tables), is quite hard to grasp for most people. Especially if there is a lot of it, this is where data visualization comes to help. The idea is to bring forth the essential aspects of the data - to tell a story. However, just putting data into a graph or figure might do more harm than good. Not only could it give wrong conclusions, but it also might be misleading. This is one of the main reasons why the exact way how you visualize the data is fundamental. This lecture is part of a series of lectures and workshops called âData visualisation.â The first lecture will discuss why data visualisation is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on. This lecture will be followed up by a workshop in May. Information about the lecture Date: 18.04.2023 Language: English Time: 10:00-12:00 Place: Zoom , the link will be sent a couple of days before the lecture Registration is closed We do ask you to register for the lecture responsibly. If you canât attend the course, please let us know as soon as possible via email at elixir@ut.ee . Learning outcomes for the participants: Understands how to tell a story through data visualization Knows what chart type to pick for different kinds of data Knows what to pay attention to while designing a figure Back to top ELIXIR Estonia ServicesÂ Terms of Use .
