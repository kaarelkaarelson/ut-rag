It is employed by professionals to monitor their progress and collaborate effectively. Its utility extends beyond software development; it can be used for books, papers, small datasets, or any evolving content that requires sharing. Git is a globally adopted tool that helps developers manage changes in collaborative projects. Keeping a record of changes, complete with timestamps and explanations, becomes exceptionally valuable when returning to a project in the future, like a year later when recollection may be unclear. Learning outcomes for the participants: Describe the importance of version control Create a repository in Git Track changes and collaborate in Git Solve conflicts in Git We ask you to register responsibly.
