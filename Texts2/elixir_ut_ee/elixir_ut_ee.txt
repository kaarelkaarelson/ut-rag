operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers. The goal of ELIXIR is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices. Estonia joined ELIXIR as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders. Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by University of Tartu .
Other partners are Tallinn University of Technology , National Institute for Physics and Biophysics , Tallinn University , and Estonian University of Life Sciences .

Online course: Data Analysis and Representation in Python This 1-day course will introduce modules and recipes to unlock the potential of Python for day-to-day data exploration and analysis of real-life datasets. This course is addressed to life scientists, bioinformaticians and researchers who are familiar with writing Python code and core Python elements and would like to explore if further in their daily data wrangling and exploration tasks. Registration deadline: 08 May 2024 More Info and Registration Continue Reading Webinar: Optimizing Python Code for Better Performance This course is addressed to life scientists, bioinformaticians and researchers who are familiar with writing Python code and core Python elements and would like to write more efficient code in order to crunch more data faster. Registration deadline: 09 May 2024 More Info and Registration Continue Reading Hybrid seminar: Game changing development in the European patenting system: all you need to know about the Unitary Patent and the UPC Patenting often seems out of reach for growing businesses and scientists without strong commercial support. However, the value of patenting for the development of innovation cannot be underestimated, so it is not surprising that the EPO introduced a new patenting system, including new type of patent and Patent Court that should make obtaining a patent easier and cheaper, freeing bright minds from unnecessary bureaucracy. The seminar will reveal the true impact of a simplified system on patenting strategy, as well as provide practical advice on its use. Date: 09.

Registration deadline: 13 May 2024 More Info and Registration Continue Reading Webinar by SIB: Gene Expression made Useful Easily: Tools and Database of Bgee This is a course on bioinformatics resources taught by the developers of the resources. Bgee is a curated database of gene expression in animals, including model species such as human, mouse or drosophila, and others such as livestock, primates, or fishes. Bgee integrates information from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq, microarrays, and in situ hybridization. These data are available through a web interface and an R package. Bgee also includes tools which use these data, such as TopAnat or Expression Comparison, and allows integration with users’ own data through another R package. In this course, we will present the curated and pre-analysed gene expression data in Bgee. Application Deadline: 17 May 2024 More Info and Registration Continue Reading Webinar: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python This course is intended for PhD students, post-docs and staff scientists who are interested in applying ML to analyze these data.

Do you write software to analyze data or implement in-silico models as part of your daily work? Do you write scientific publications based on software you created yourself but do not know what unit testing, refactoring or version control are? Are you writing code that you find hard to understand some weeks later? Do you have thousands of lines of code, but no automated way of verifying that the code works correctly? Do you find yourself regularly using âcopy & pasteâ to re-use code you wrote earlier? Do small changes in your code later cause trouble in other unexpected places?
