For example, scRNAseq can help to identify expression patterns that differ between conditions within a cell-type. To generate and analyze scRNAseq data, several methods are available, all with their strengths and weaknesses depending on the researchersâ needs. This 3-day course will cover the main technologies as well as the main aspects to consider while designing a scRNAseq experiment. In addition, it will cover the theoretical background of analysis methods with hands-on practical data analysis sessions applied to droplet-based methods.

It compiles and runs on various UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. RStudio is an essential tool for anyone involved in R programming. It plays a vital role in data analysis by facilitating data import, access, transformation, exploration, visualization, and modeling tasks.If you're embarking on your journey to learn R, now is the perfect moment to familiarize yourself with RStudio. Discover what RStudio is, how to install it, and begin harnessing its capabilities to enhance your data analysis and programming skills. This workshop will be followed up by âVisualisation with RStudioâ Learning outcomes for the participants: Navigate RStudio features, write and execute R scripts, and manage projects efficiently within the IDE. Import, clean, and manipulate data We ask you to register responsibly. If you can't attend the lecture, please let us know as soon as possible via email (elixir@ut.ee).
