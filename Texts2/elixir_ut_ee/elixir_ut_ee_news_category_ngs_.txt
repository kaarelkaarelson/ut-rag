Using different datasets, we will practice quality control, alignment of reads to a reference genome and visualize the output. This course is intended for life scientists who are already dealing with NGS data and would like to be able to start analysing them. Application deadline: 01 April 2024 More Info and Registration Continue reading January 29, 2024 in workshop , bioinformatics , NGS 1 min read Course at  Bern, Switzerland: NGS - Genome Variant Analysis The detection of genetic variation is of major interest in various disciplines spanning from ecology and evolution research to inherited disease discovery and precision oncology. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are very powerful for the detection of genomic variants. Thanks to its throughput and cost-efficiency it enables the detection of a large number of variants in a large number of samples. In this two-day course we will cover the steps from read alignment to variant calling and annotation. We will mainly focus on the detection of germline mutations by following the GATK best practices.
