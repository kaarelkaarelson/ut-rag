In very practical and interactive sessions, participants will learn about Nextflow technology starting from basic through more advanced concepts, with the expectation they will acquire the proficiency to develop and deploy their own workflows. This 2-day course will train participants to build Nextflow pipelines and run them. It is designed to provide participants with short and frequent hands-on sessions, while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum. A GitHub repository will be provided with all the necessary material and software installation guidelines. Audience This hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using Nextflow to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. Learning outcomes At the end of the course, participants are expected to be able to: Develop a Nextflow pipeline from scratch. Describe and explain Nextflow's basic concepts. Implement short blocks of code into a Nextflow pipeline. Execute/Run a Nextflow pipeline. Test and modify a Nextflow pipeline. Locate and fetch Nextflow pipelines from dedicated repositories. Run a pipeline in diverse computational environments (local, HPC, cloud). Share a pipeline. Prerequisites Knowledge / competencies Applicants should be comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment. If you do not feel comfortable with UNIX commands, you can refresh your knowledge with the UNIX Shell course materials here . Participants will need to connect during the course to a remote server via the "ssh" protocol. You can learn how does ssh work in here . Participants should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, which are already available in the server) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely. Instructor will be using VS Code with SSH extension, it is recommended to use the same text editor for ease of comparison. Knowledge of containers is not mandatory; however, recommended. Participants are preferred to bring their own laptop but also local Linux computers can be used (please let us know about it during the registration). They will work in their local machine to learn the basics and develop their very first pipeline. They will also work in a dedicated UT HPC environment in order to learn running pipelines in different computation environments. Schedule 22.11.2021 Day 1: Introduction to Nextflow. Learning the building blocks 23.11.2021 Day 2: Understand, develop and run a basic Nextflow pipeline The course runs from 10.15-18.00. Registration Please register responsively. Due to COVID-19 situation we accept only fully vaccinated persons who must bring and show the vaccination certificate AND take a rapid antigen test before the course starts during Day 1 (9.30 on Monday 22.11.2021).

(registration closed) On the 25th of November 2021, ELIXIR-Estonia will be holding a new data management online course: How to make your messy data usable. The course will be held in English. This course will be in two parts: an 1 hour online lecture on what makes a data table usable for other people held on 25th of November at 13:00 in Zoom. The practical workshop on cleaning your messy data with OpenRefine software will be a video lecture that you can follow in your own time. Additionally, we will hold 3 Q&A sessions in Zoom, where you can talk about any problems you encountered with the OpenRefine software. More attention is put on what researchers do with the data (and other resources) they produce in recent years, especially in Europe, also in everywhere else. Since most of your data needs to be uploaded to a repository, it is essential that the data is tidy and other people understand and can easily read your data. In this course, we will be going over how to name your files and variables, version control, compile a data dictionary, and what to do with empty cells. In the second part, OpenRefine software is introduced. With this, you can easily clean up the messy data. For the more practical aspect of using the OpenRefine software, I will share a video that will teach the basics. You can watch it anytime and do the lessons yourself. On three days (29.11, 30.11 and 1.12) there will be a 1h slot (11:00-12:00) on Zoom, when you can come and ask any question you have regarding tables and OpenRefine software.

September 17, 2021 in FAIR principles , DM courses , lecture 2 min read The FAIR Principles Lecture (registration closed) On the 27th of September, 2021 and on 14th of October, 2021, ELIXIR-Estonia will be holding a new data management course: The FAIR Principles. This lecture will be a short overview about the principles and is part of a bigger data management course package. The first course, on 27th of September, will be held in Estonian, and the second course, on 14th of October, will be held in English. The FAIR Principles Lecture 27th of September, 14:15-17:00 (in ESTONIAN) and 14th of October, 12:15-15:00 (in ENGLISH), Delta #1019 In recent years, more attention is put on what researchers do with the data (and other resources) they produce. Especially in Europe, but also everywhere else. The main idea is that when researchers use taxpayers' money, the taxpayers themselves should also have access to the results, free of charge. This means that the research should be published in open access journals and data should be made publicly available. Good data management may help you with that, at least to make the process easier on the whole. If you think âhow to manage your dataâ at the beginning and during the project and know what you plan to do with it at the end of the project, the process at the end will be easier. However, what is âgood data managementâ, is up to debate. The FAIR Principles concentrates on making your data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, so this is a good start. And letâs be honest, some of these things you are probably already doing. In this course, we will be going over all the FAIR Principles and how they are applied in real life. This way, you will already know what to consider, while writing a grant, filling out your data management plan or doing your research.

Seventy-six percent of companies surveyed in our newest report âOpen data: a driving force for innovation in the life sciencesâ state that their product or service would not exist without data on open repositories. While the importance of these freely available resources is widely accepted, there are sparse efforts to quantify the benefit, despite the need to demonstrate value to funders and policymakers. This report is an up-to-date quantification on the benefit of open data to industry and innovation, with an extensive survey, testimonials, and analysis of the hotspots of European innovation.
