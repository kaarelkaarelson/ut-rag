These data are open and available to be looked at within Galaxy and please feedback to bjoern.gruening@gmail.com if you require specific analysis on this data. The ELIXIR Tools Platform published a paper " Towards FAIR principles for research software ". The paper analyses how FAIR principles can be applied to software, as opposed to data. It also explores whether existing FAIR principles can be applied directly to software, or where they need to be adapted or reinterpreted. This publication coincides with the launch of fair-software.nl website, which provides recommendations on ways to improve the quality and reproducibility of software. The programme of SIB training courses for 2020 is now online. Over 20 courses are already planned, and lots more are yet to come!  The topics covered span areas such as NGS and other omics data analysis, single-cell, statistics, programming, machine learning, and several SIB resources.

Galaxy is meant for supporting data intensive research in a convenient manner through building and using custom workflows. Biological data analysis often deals with lists of genes arising from various studies. The gProfiler toolset is widely used for finding biological categories enriched in gene lists, conversions between gene identifiers and mappings to their orthologs. The mission of gProfiler is to provide a reliable service based on up-to-date high quality data in a convenient manner across many evidence types, identifier spaces and organisms. gProfiler relies on data retrieved from Ensembl database and fungi, plants or metazoa specific versions of Ensembl Genomes, and parasite specific data from WormBase ParaSite. In addition to Gene Ontology, supported data sources include KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways, TRANSFAC, miRTarBase, Human Protein Atlas, CORUM and HP. gProfiler supports close to 500 organisms and accepts hundreds of identifier types . gProfiler has been supporting developers by offering a standardized access through public APIs. The usage of APIs was simplified by wrapping them into Python and R packages. The latter, `gprofiler2` (which was published as a Conda Forge package named `r-gprofiler2`), was wrapped to be used as a set of Galaxy tools: gProfiler GOSt performs functional enrichment analysis, also known as over-representation analysis (ORA) or gene set enrichment analysis, on input gene list; in addition to the detailed tabular results, it can also create a Plotly graph with the Manhattan plot very similar to the one shown by the web tool . gProfiler Convert enables to convert between various gene, protein, microarray probe and numerous other types of namespaces gProfiler Orth translates gene identifiers between organisms gProfiler SNPense maps SNP rs-codes to gene names, chromosomal coordinates and variant effects gProfiler Random fetches a (not actually random) list of gene identifiers; useful for testing purposes. gProfiler Galaxy toolset was admitted to the Galaxy Tools IUC. It is distributed via the ToolShed and can be installed as a bundle with the gProfiler tool suite repository. gProfiler is part of the ELIXIR infrastructure. It belongs to the portfolio of ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources . gProfiler is developed and maintained in Estonia, at the University of Tartu , Institute of Computer Science , BIIT research group . It is an ELIXIR Estonia service . Our latest publication of the g:Profiler tool - Uku Raudvere, Liis Kolberg, Ivan Kuzmin, Tambet Arak, Priit Adler, Hedi Peterson, Jaak Vilo: g:Profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Research 2019; doi:10.1093/nar/gkz369 October 21, 2019 2 min read Weekly news 21.10.2019 The slides and recording of the presentation on the ELIXIR Beacon & Beacon Network as a service are now available on the ELIXIR website .

Some basic experience with programming and scripting languages like python, perl, R, matlab, etc. are an advantage, but not needed. The course is also relevant for Data Stewards who are supporting the life science researchers. The course will introduce the trainees to important concepts of data stewardship. We start with a general introduction covering the data life cycle, the FAIR principles and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards. The course will introduce the trainees to important concepts of data stewardship . We start with a general introduction covering the data life cycle, the FAIR principles and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards. We will pass the stages of the data life cycle in more detail in the training modules of this 3 day course. Day 1: Why use a data management plan and what for? On day one trainees will investigate data management plans, which types are there and how they should be used. Day 2: Mastering the data chaos during the research phase. On day two the course highlights how to work with data during the research phase, explaining how to create well formatted data which helps in the second module of day two to make data interoperable already during the active research phase. Day 3: Boost your visibility and get cited for your data! On day three trainees will have an in-depth at persistent identifiers, different use cases and types of identifiers. Finally we are closing the data life cycle by making data fit for sharing, archiving and publishing. The training is organised by DTL and delivered as a joint effort by DTL partners. You can find all the information, including the full programme and registration possibilities here: https://www.aanmelder.nl/data-stewardship-course/part_program . This course is part of the Data Analysis and Stewardship theme of Helis Academy and is organised by DTL and DTL collaborators.

Abstract: Elsevier is a global information analytics business that helps institutions and professionals advance healthcare and open science to improve performance for the benefit of humanity. In this webinar, we will discuss how Elsevier is increasingly leveraging the FAIR Guiding Principles to improve its products and services to better serve the scientific community. Ted is one of the authors on the seminal 2016 FAIR guiding principles paper. He has worked extensively within pharma R & D and more recently for providers of data analytics. Fotis Psomopoulos (ELIXIR-GR) has been selected to be an Research Data Alliance ( RDA) Europe Ambassador for Bioinformatics. Part of his activities in this role will be to act as the formal RDA liaison for the ELIXIR Training Platform, with an additional focus on early career researchers at the intersection of Life Sciences and RDA.
