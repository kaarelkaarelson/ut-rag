He received his PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from Konstanz University, Germany in 2007. He received his BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science from the Information Systems department at the Faculty of Computers and Information in Cairo University, Egypt, in 2000 and 2003 respectively. Before joining the University of Tartu, he held appointments in several international organizations including University of New South Wales (Australia), Macquarie University (Australia), Data61/CSIRO (Australia), Microsoft Research (USA), Nokia Bell Labs (Ireland) and King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (Saudia Arabia). He also held several visiting appointments at Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin (Germany), University of Zurich (Switzerland) and Technical Unversity of Dresden (Germany). Prof. Sakr's research interest is data and information management in general, particularly in big data processing systems, big data analytics, data science and big data management in cloud computing platforms. Prof. Sakr published more than 150 refereed research publications in international journals and conferences such as: Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB), IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (IEEE TPDS), IEEE Transactions on Service Computing (IEEE TSC), IEEE Transactions on Big Data (IEEE TBD), ACM Computing Survey (ACM CSUR), Journal of Computer, Systems and Science (JCSS), Information Systems, Cluster Computing, Grid Computing, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (IEEE COMST), IEEE Software, Scientometrics, VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE, EDBT, WWW, CIKM, CAiSE, ISWC, BPM, ER, ICWS, ICSOC, IEEE SCC, IEEE Cloud, TPCTC, DASFAA, ICPE and JCDL. One of his papers has been awarded the Outstanding Paper Excellence Award 2009 of Emerald Literati Network. He is also a winner of CAiSE'19 best paper award. Prof. Sakr was a constant reviewer for VLDB J., ACM TODS, ACM CSUR, ACM TWEB, ACM TAAS, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TSC, IEEE TBD, IEEE TCC, IEEE Software, DKE Elsevier, JSS Elsevier, WWW Springer, Distributed and Parallel Databases Springer and many other international conferences and journals. Prof. Sakr was an associate editor of the cluster computing journal and Transactions on Large-Scale Data and Knowledge-Centered Systems (TLDKS). He was serving as a guest editor for several special issues in various reputable journals including Future Generation Computer Systems and Big Data Research. He is also an editorial board member of many reputable international journals. Prof. Sakr is an ACM Senior Member and an IEEE Senior Member. In 2017, he had been appointed to serve as an ACM Distinguished Speaker and as an IEEE Distinguished Speaker . Prof. Sakr was serving as the Editor-in-Chief of the Springer Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies . He was also serving as a Co-Chair for the European Big Data Value Association (BDVA) TF6-Data Technology Architectures Group.
