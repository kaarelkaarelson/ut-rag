Programmeerimine - Kursused - Arvutiteaduse instituut Kursused 2023/24 kevad Programmeerimine (LTAT.03.001) EN Logi sisse Programmeerimine 2023/24 kevad Home Computer Programming This is the introductory programming course for Cybersecurity and other students. No previous knowledge of programming or prerequisite subjects are required, other than basic computer skills. The course consists of video lectures by Charles Severance and/or reading materials, and there are online practice sessions on Fridays. The course is held entirely online, so please make sure that you have a computer with a stable Internet connection. The programming language is Python. All necessary software will be made available to the course participants. Before each practice session, you have to watch the video lectures, solve a quiz about the current topic, and solve and submit programming exercises. In the practice sessions, main topics and exercises are reviewed, and more exercises are solved.

Grading Time Max Min Comment Deadline Quizzes + homeworks Weeks 1-16 14 7 0.5+0.5 points per week Before each session Practice sessions Weeks 1-16 6 0.5 points per week Each session Project Weeks 7-16 16 8 In two parts (8 + 8) Week 12 + Week 16 First test Week 6 20 Quiz passed Quiz + programming Second test Week 11 20 Quiz passed Quiz + programming Exam In June 24 Quiz passed Quiz + programming Extra exercises 10 To get points for the pre-session work (quizzes + programming homeworks), it has to be submitted through Moodle before each session by Friday 8:00. In grading the homeworks, effort is preferred to correctness. To get points for the practice session work, active involvement and own contribution should be visible; submission closes on Sunday evening. To pass the quiz parts of the tests and exam, all questions must be answered correctly (small mistakes don't count). Weekly quizzes don't have a threshold. For a positive grade in the course, all minimum thresholds must be met. During the semester, you can see your current points and feedback in Moodle. Grades: A ≥ 90, B ≥ 80, C ≥ 70, D ≥ 60, E ≥ 50, F < 50. Learning Outcomes After passing this course, the student: knows and can use fundamental programming constructions: variables, expressions, assignments, conditionals, loops, subroutines, recursion, simple input/output knows basic data types and -structures (numeric types, booleans, strings, lists, etc.) and can use corresponding standard operations can analyze and explain in detail the behavior of simple programs and modify, complement, and develop them can design algorithms for solving simple problems and implement, test, and debug the corresponding program can implement projects related to programming in collaboration with teammates. The average workload in the course is 6-9 hours of study each week.
