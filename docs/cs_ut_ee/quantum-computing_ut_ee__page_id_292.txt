Dirk Oliver Theis Associate Professor Diplom in mathematics, Heidelberg (8/2002) Dr. rer.nat. , Heidelberg (12/2005, summa cum laude üîó ) Habilitation to Priv.-Doz. in mathematics,  Magdeburg  (5/2012) Assoc. Prof. in Theoretical Computer Science üîó at Uni Tartu , Estonia , EU, Earth (since 3/2013) Research Who I am: Theoretical computer science, applicable mathematics. What I do: Quantum computing. Theoretical computer science and mathematics are about proving theorems, which is what I (try to) do most of the time. To assess the practical utility of results that I obtain on paper, I also often write prototype source code. Apart from pure theory, I‚Äôm fond of compiler engineering (classical and hybrid-quantum/classical). With my research, I aim to contribute to realizing quantum computing within this decade. My recent papers: On SciRate My ArXiv tag My ORCID stub will, at some point in the future üôÑ, offer a selection of my favorite recent papers & preprints.
