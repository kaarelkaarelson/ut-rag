Pathfinding Run algorithm Dijkstra A* Search Best-first search Slow Fast Gradient Solid Rainbow Generate maze Easy Medium Hard Very hard Clear path Clear board See tutorial Tutorial Ã— Hello! This is tutorial how to use this path visualization tool. Start and end nodes Green node shows start point and red node shows end point. If You would like to move any node, You should
                press on it and drag where You want to locate it. Walls If You want to draw wall, just press left mouse button on any white node and start moving it. If You want to remove any wall, just press on black node and
                start moving mouse. You also may want to generate maze. For that You can choose difficulty if maze generation in selector and press button "Generate maze" Algorithms Given tool has two algorithms - Dijsktra, A* and Best-First Search. To start any algorithm, You have to choose it from selector (You can also change the speed) and press button "Run algorithm"
