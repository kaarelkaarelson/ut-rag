The solution provides two-factor authentication. The authentication factor “something you have” is implemented by performing cryptographic checks to verify the authenticity of an eMRTD, but the authentication factor “something you are” is verified by comparing the facial image of the person presenting the document with the facial image stored in the document. The solution has been successfully tested on Estonian, Latvian, and Turkish identity documents and is also expected to work on documents issued by other countries.
