Shaping & Designing Future Mobility and Sustainability The Intelligent Transportation Systems Lab (ITS Lab) is a research group at the University of Tartu, Estonia. We are interested in the development of intelligent transportation systems, including autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles, and intelligent transportation infrastructure. We are also interested in the development of machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transportation applications. Mobility and transportation have been essential parts of humankind's existence. They are key factors in the evolution of technology and economy. Traffic and mobility problems are the results of concentration of population and markets. Hence, the challenges in mobility are related to many factors and actors, such as vehicle safety, sustainability, traffic jams, incidents, human behaviour, etc. From this perspective, our ITS Team focuses on contributing in the following fields: Mobility Modeling, Traffic Simulation, Advanced Travel Information Systems, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Vehicular Networking.
