It is employed by professionals to monitor their progress and collaborate effectively. Its utility extends beyond software development; it can be used for books, papers, small datasets, or any evolving content that requires sharing. Git is a globally adopted tool that helps developers manage changes in collaborative projects. Keeping a record of changes, complete with timestamps and explanations, becomes exceptionally valuable when returning to a project in the future, like a year later when recollection may be unclear. Learning outcomes for the participants: Describe the importance of version control Create a repository in Git Track changes and collaborate in Git Solve conflicts in Git We ask you to register responsibly.

Git is used across the world to help developers keep track of changes while working on different parts of the same project. Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded). Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: itâs what professionals use to keep track of what theyâve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isnât just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.
