We will talk about the principles of computing in a cluster and the difference between computing directly from the command line of a private server. We will introduce the good practices and standards of behavior that good cluster usage practice requires. Also the convenient graphical tools for monitoring the resource of your work will be covered. Finally, we might touch on the basic Slurm commands. We expect the users to have basic LINUX command line experience, but very little or no cluster compute experience yet. Learning outcome: Knowing how to submit, monitor and control jobs at UT HPC. The seminar will take place in Zoom on 18th of November 2021 at 14.00 and will last approximately 90 minutes. The seminar will not be recorded. Registration is open at https://forms.gle/pVe86HVqjWB6GpLg8 and will close on 16th of November or when the course gets full. The seminar is held in English by Ulvi Gerst Talas and Ott Eric Oopkaup from UT HPC/ETAIS. Back to top ELIXIR Estonia ServicesÂ Terms of Use . ELIXIR Estonia follows ELIXIR Code
