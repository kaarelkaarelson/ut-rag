You will also learn how to do integrated analysis of two samples. 18.-19.9.2019 Single cell RNA-seq data analysis using R In order to participate in this course, you need to have prior experience in using R. Teachers: Heli Pessa, Bishwa Ghimire, Iivari Kleino For more information and registration, please see https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/single-cell-r-2019 24.9.2019 Single cell RNA-seq data analysis using Chipster As the R-based tools are used via the graphical user interface of Chipster, no experience of R is required, and the course is thus suitable for everybody. Teachers: Maria Lehtivaara and Eija Korpelainen For more information and registration, please see https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/single-cell-chipster-2019 Note that you can combine these courses with the international Single cell transcriptomics symposium, which takes place in Biomedicum Helsinki 23.9.2019. For more information and registration, please see https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/immunomics/single-cell-course-week/single-cell-transcriptomics-symposium-2019 Finally, all the material from the ELIXIR course "Single cell RNA-seq data analysis with R" (27.-29.5.2019) is now available at https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/scrnaseq The material includes lecture videos, slides, exercises with code, and exercise data.
