The course will be held in English. When handling any kind of information that may help to identify a person, whether directly or indirectly, it must be handled with care. Particular attention should be put to collecting, processing, handling, and storing the data throughout the research process. This is meant for both textual, but also audio, video, and picture data. However, what does this mean for the researcher? In this lecture, we will go over what GDPR and the Estonian Personal Data Protection Act say when dealing with personal data. Also, we will concentrate on what it means for the researcher working with this data and what he/she/they need to do to abide by these laws. This lecture will also cover the consent form and anonymization/pseudonymization processes.
