We will talk about the principles of computing in a cluster and the difference between computing directly from the command line of a private server. We will introduce the good practices and standards of behavior that good cluster usage practice requires. Also the convenient graphical tools for monitoring the resource of your work will be covered. Finally, we might touch on the basic Slurm commands. We expect the users to have basic LINUX command line experience, but very little or no cluster compute experience yet. Learning outcome: Knowing how to submit, monitor and control jobs at UT HPC. The seminar will take place in Zoom on 18th of November 2021 at 14.00 and will last approximately 90 minutes. The seminar will not be recorded. Registration is open at https://forms.gle/pVe86HVqjWB6GpLg8 and will close on 16th of November or when the course gets full. The seminar is held in English by Ulvi Gerst Talas and Ott Eric Oopkaup from UT HPC/ETAIS.

August 7, 2019 in training , course , single-cell , csc , elixir-fi 1 min read Single cell RNA-seq analysis courses by ELIXIR-FI in Espoo Please note that registration is now open for the following two single cell RNA-seq data analysis courses, which cover the processing of transcript counts from quality control and filtering to dimensional reduction, clustering, and differential expression analysis. You will also learn how to do integrated analysis of two samples. 18.-19.9.2019 Single cell RNA-seq data analysis using R In order to participate in this course, you need to have prior experience in using R. Teachers: Heli Pessa, Bishwa Ghimire, Iivari Kleino For more information and registration, please see https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/single-cell-r-2019 24.9.2019 Single cell RNA-seq data analysis using Chipster As the R-based tools are used via the graphical user interface of Chipster, no experience of R is required, and the course is thus suitable for everybody. Teachers: Maria Lehtivaara and Eija Korpelainen For more information and registration, please see https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/single-cell-chipster-2019 Note that you can combine these courses with the international Single cell transcriptomics symposium, which takes place in Biomedicum Helsinki 23.9.2019. For more information and registration, please see https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/immunomics/single-cell-course-week/single-cell-transcriptomics-symposium-2019 Finally, all the material from the ELIXIR course "Single cell RNA-seq data analysis with R" (27.-29.5.2019) is now available at https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/scrnaseq The material includes lecture videos, slides, exercises with code, and exercise data. April 25, 2019 in training , course , data-management , FAIR 2 min read FAIR Data Stewardship â digital data scholarship for wetlab scientists - course in the Netherlands From 27-29 May, 2019, we will organize the first course in  Data Analysis and Stewardship theme of the Helis Academy: FAIR Data Stewardship â digital data scholarship for wetlab scientists The target audience is wet-lab scientists â from industry and academia â and graduate students in the Life Sciences who wish to improve their digital scholarship on data handling. Some basic experience with programming and scripting languages like python, perl, R, matlab, etc. are an advantage, but not needed. The course will introduce the trainees to important concepts of data stewardship. We start with a general introduction covering the data life cycle, the FAIR principles and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards. The course is also relevant for Data Stewards who are supporting the life science researchers. We will pass the stages of the data life cycle in more detail in the training modules of this 3 day course. On day one trainees will investigate data management plans, which types are there and how they should be used. On day two the course highlights how to work with data during the research phase, explaining how to create well formatted data which helps in the second module of day two to make data interoperable already during the active research phase. On day three trainees will have an in-depth at persistent identifiers, different use cases and types of identifiers. Finally we are closing the data life cycle by making data fit for sharing, archiving and publishing. This course is part of the Data Analysis and Stewardship theme of Helis Academy and is organised by DTL and DTL collaborators. Info about other courses in the theme of Data Analysis and Stewardship can be found on the Helis Academy website and on the Helis Academy page on the DTL website .
