As a general rule these high performance computer resources use Linux operating systems and are accessible only by a shell terminal. This course is aimed to streamline your skills in Linux and terminal environment. We will teach you how to make your life easier by creating maintainable and flexible bash scripts for your commonly used workflows or SLURM jobs. Objectives: Learn how to iterate operations over many input files with bash loops and conditions. Learn how to combine complicated command line based workflows into maintainable bash scripts. Add additional useful utility functions and tools to your toolbox. Expected prior knowledge: Experience in using the basic commands covered in the Basics course (e.g. cd, ls, mkdir, mv, cp, head, cat, find, less, pwd). Requirements: Lecture venue is computer class with linux computers. In case you bring your own Windows laptop, please make sure to install Putty application (https://www.putty.org/) beforehand.
