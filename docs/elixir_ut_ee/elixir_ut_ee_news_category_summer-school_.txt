This course provides an introduction to the use of bioinformatics in biological research, giving participants guidance for using bioinformatics in their work whilst also providing hands-on training in tools and resources appropriate to their research. Participants will initially be introduced to bioinformatics theory and practice, including best practices for undertaking bioinformatics analysis, data management, and reproducibility. To enable specific exploration of resources in their particular field of interest, participants will then be divided into focused groups to work on a project. Participants will be required to review some pre-recorded material prior to the start of the course. Information about the summer school Date : 12 - 16 June 2023 Application deadline : 05 March 2023 Cost : Â£825.00 inclusive of four nights accommodation and catering, including dinner Participant limit : Open application with selection 30 places More info : https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/summer-school-bioinformatics-0/ Group projects : Genome variation across human populations Interpreting functional information from large scale protein structure data Modelling cell signalling pathways Networks and pathways Reusing FAIR Bioimage data: an AI application Who is this course for? Applicants are expected to be at an early stage of using bioinformatics in their research with the need to develop their knowledge and skills further. No previous knowledge of programming is required for this course; group projects may give you the opportunity to learn basic programming, but participants will be supported in this by their mentors. Depending on your chosen project, an introductory programming tutorial may be given as homework prior to attending the course. Learning outcomes After this course you should be able to: Discuss applications of bioinformatics in biological research Browse, search, and retrieve biological data from public repositories Use appropriate bioinformatics tools to explore biological data Describe ways that biological data can be stored, organised and integrated Back to top ELIXIR Estonia ServicesÂ Terms of Use .
