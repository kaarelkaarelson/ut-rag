First, we will cover spreadsheet best practices. Then, we will put that knowledge into practice with OpenRefine. This course will explore the depths of OpenRefine software and see what it can offer. This will include cleaning the data in bigger batches and unifying the data in one sweep (transforms and expressions). Additionally, we will introduce the possibility of downloading additional data from other databases and different extensions OpenRefine software has. Learning outcomes for the participants: Describe spreadsheet best practices Compare Excel and OpenRefine Apply transforms (cell editing, column editing, transposing) in OpenRefine Write simple expressions in OpenRefine Match your dataset with that of an external source We ask you to register responsibly.
