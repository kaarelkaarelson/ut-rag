We will talk about the principles of computing in a cluster and the difference between computing directly from the command line of a private server. We will introduce the good practices and standards of behavior that good cluster usage practice requires. Also the convenient graphical tools for monitoring the resource of your work will be covered. Finally, we might touch on the basic Slurm commands. We expect the users to have basic LINUX command line experience, but very little or no cluster compute experience yet. Learning outcome: Knowing how to submit, monitor and control jobs at UT HPC. The seminar will take place in Zoom on 18th of November 2021 at 14.00 and will last approximately 90 minutes. The seminar will not be recorded. Registration is open at https://forms.gle/pVe86HVqjWB6GpLg8 and will close on 16th of November or when the course gets full. The seminar is held in English by Ulvi Gerst Talas and Ott Eric Oopkaup from UT HPC/ETAIS.

More researchers are writing code to process, analyse and visualise their data. For reproducible and robust research, it is increasingly important that this code is reviewed. Join this inaugural Open Science Coffee to learn more and discuss best practices, challenges and opportunities in reviewing research code.

How to do it well? How to write a data management plan? If you have these questions, then Helis Academy can help you out. They provide a variety of courses and seminars about data management and data stewardship. On 17th and 18th of June, they will host a 2-day event, introducing their academy and Data Analysis and Data Stewardship ( https://helisacademy.com/en/data-analysis-stewardship )  project with one of its aims to increase the industry readiness in Health and LifeSciences by developing training programmes in line with the knowledge and skills that are required in the industry. Helis is organizing 2 half-day events, filled with informative, interactive sessions: Day 1: Symposium (17 June 2021)  9.30-13.00 CEST, Online Youâll learn more about the Helis project, the cross-border collaboration programme, how careers in life sciences are stimulated and the Helis domains during keynotes and interactive parallel sessions.  More info: https://helisacademy.com/en/closing-event/symposium Day 2: Virtual company visits (18 June 2021) 8.30-13 CEST Curious to learn more about the life sciences sector in the Netherlands and Flanders? Join the virtual company visits on 18 June to find out more about the diverse job opportunities and career paths that the life sciences domains offer.  More info: https://helisacademy.com/en/closing-event/student-programme The data analysis and stewardship pillar of Helis  is organized by DTL/ ELIXIR-NL, VIB/ELIXIR-Belgium, Maastricht University and Eindhoven University of Techonology (TU/e).

The hackathon will be a practical online event to investigate gaps in the application of FAIR principles to project outputs and facilitate the implementation of FAIR approaches, where possible. The Hackathon will focus on cohort data, software tools including workflows, algorithms as well as web services, and training materials. The hackathon will be preceded by a âHow FAIR are youâ webinar series to provide background and introduce theoretical concepts that might be useful during the practical sessions. All participants are encouraged to attend or watch the recordings of the webinar series. The webinar topics include: Introduction to FAIR principles - Open science through FAIR health data networks: dream or reality? Making Cohort data FAIR FAIR Software tools Practically Fair How to make training FAIR Ethics/ELSI considerations - From FAIR to fair data sharing More information and registration is available at https://www.cineca-project.eu/news-events-all/how-fair-are-you-webinar-series-and-hackathon .
