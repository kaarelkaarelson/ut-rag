Do you write software to analyze data or implement in-silico models as part of your daily work? Do you write scientific publications based on software you created yourself but do not know what unit testing, refactoring or version control are? Are you writing code that you find hard to understand some weeks later? Do you have thousands of lines of code, but no automated way of verifying that the code works correctly? Do you find yourself regularly using âcopy & pasteâ to re-use code you wrote earlier? Do small changes in your code later cause trouble in other unexpected places?
