Do you write software to analyze data or implement in-silico models as part of your daily work? Do you write scientific publications based on software you created yourself but do not know what unit testing, refactoring or version control are? Are you writing code that you find hard to understand some weeks later? Do you have thousands of lines of code, but no automated way of verifying that the code works correctly? Do you find yourself regularly using âcopy & pasteâ to re-use code you wrote earlier? Do small changes in your code later cause trouble in other unexpected places? Registration deadline: 17 June 2024 Date: 03 - 04 July 2024 More Info and Registration General information Time: 03 - 04 July 2024 Registration deadline: 17 June 2024 Location: ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland Level: Intermediate Fees: Academic: 200 CHF For-profit: 1000 CHF Materials: https://siscourses.ethz.ch/sib_workshop_best_practices/ Description The workshop will focus on learning and internalizing the practices of unit testing, refactoring, and version control through hands-on experience. The first morning will start with an introduction into these concepts and tools used to support them. In the afternoon, we will transition to a code clinic and work together in small groups applying these practices to make improvements to code brought by participants. The second day will continue with the code clinic. The focus of this course is not object-oriented programming, software architecture, design patterns or algorithms. The goal of this course is to introduce skills and techniques for effectively developing software. Prerequisites Working knowledge of one of the following programming languages: R, python, C/C++, java, perl, Matlab.
Participants will need send some extracts of their code at least 2 weeks before the course Learning outcomes At the end of the workshop, the participants should be able to: identify and avoid the most common mistakes in the process of writing software in a scientific context improve the quality of her/his code exploit techniques for effectively developing software Registration Registration More Info Back to top ELIXIR Estonia ServicesÂ Terms of Use .
