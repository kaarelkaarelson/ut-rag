You will also learn how to do integrated analysis of two samples. 18.-19.9.2019 Single cell RNA-seq data analysis using R In order to participate in this course, you need to have prior experience in using R. Teachers: Heli Pessa, Bishwa Ghimire, Iivari Kleino For more information and registration, please see https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/single-cell-r-2019 24.9.2019 Single cell RNA-seq data analysis using Chipster As the R-based tools are used via the graphical user interface of Chipster, no experience of R is required, and the course is thus suitable for everybody. Teachers: Maria Lehtivaara and Eija Korpelainen For more information and registration, please see https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/single-cell-chipster-2019 Note that you can combine these courses with the international Single cell transcriptomics symposium, which takes place in Biomedicum Helsinki 23.9.2019. For more information and registration, please see https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/immunomics/single-cell-course-week/single-cell-transcriptomics-symposium-2019 Finally, all the material from the ELIXIR course "Single cell RNA-seq data analysis with R" (27.-29.5.2019) is now available at https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/scrnaseq The material includes lecture videos, slides, exercises with code, and exercise data.

Some basic experience with programming and scripting languages like python, perl, R, matlab, etc. are an advantage, but not needed. The course will introduce the trainees to important concepts of data stewardship. We start with a general introduction covering the data life cycle, the FAIR principles and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards. The course is also relevant for Data Stewards who are supporting the life science researchers. We will pass the stages of the data life cycle in more detail in the training modules of this 3 day course. On day one trainees will investigate data management plans, which types are there and how they should be used. On day two the course highlights how to work with data during the research phase, explaining how to create well formatted data which helps in the second module of day two to make data interoperable already during the active research phase. On day three trainees will have an in-depth at persistent identifiers, different use cases and types of identifiers. Finally we are closing the data life cycle by making data fit for sharing, archiving and publishing. This course is part of the Data Analysis and Stewardship theme of Helis Academy and is organised by DTL and DTL collaborators. Info about other courses in the theme of Data Analysis and Stewardship can be found on the Helis Academy website and on the Helis Academy page on the DTL website .
