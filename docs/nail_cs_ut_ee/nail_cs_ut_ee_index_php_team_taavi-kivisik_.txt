Taavi Kivisik – Natural and Artificial Intelligence Lab Research People Publications Courses Taavi Kivisik The invention of a wheelbarrow allowed a weaker individual with a wheelbarrow to carry more weight than a stronger individual without a wheelbarrow. My research designs new “wheelbarrows” for human thinking and AI systems. For example, one project involves studying the characteristics of different ways of thinking about time (a week) and designing new representations with novel properties. Taavi has master’s degree in experimental psychology (cognitive science), lived in 5 countries for at least 5 months as an adult, and worked as a data scientist and developer for 3 years before starting the PhD studies.
