For human-centric information systems, it is crucial to understand, elicit and represent social, informational, and psychological context of the software system to be introduced. For this purpose, the book proposes a requirements engineering methodology that is centred on the viewpoint framework defined by Leon Sterling and Kuldar Taveter (2009) . The viewpoint framework consists of a matrix with three rows representing the abstraction layers of problem domain analysis, design and implementation and three columns representing the perspectives of interactions, information and behaviour. Each cell in this matrix represents a specific viewpoint, such as interaction analysis, information design and behaviour implementation. The interaction, information and behaviour perspectives are respectively geared towards eliciting and representing social, informational and psychological contexts. Each of these perspectives can be represented by appropriate models. Recently, the requirements engineering methodology was elaborated in Chapter 5 Agent-Oriented Modeling of the book by Emilio Sulis and Kuldar Taveter .
